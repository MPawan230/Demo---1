    <h2 style="font-family: Calibri;">Introduction to Robotics and it's applications. </h2>
    <p align="justify" style="font-family: Calibri;">Robotics is an inter disciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and technology
        to create machines capable of performing various task autonomously. These robots are often programmed to perform
        specific task, such as assembling products on a factory line, assisting in surgeries, or even exploring distant
        planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries, healthcare, exploration, and personnel use
        leading to innovation in sectors that previously relied heavily on manual labor.
    </p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-family: Calibri;">In recent years advancement in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies
        have greatly
        enhanced the capabilities of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset instructions, but
        autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting with their environment from robotic arms in
        manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and has become critical part
        of modern society.

    <h2 style="font-family: Calibri;">Key Advancement in Industrial Automation. </h2>
    <p align="justify" style="font-family: Calibri;">Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes that previously required
        human labor. The most common types of industrial robots include robotic arms, which are widely used in the
        automotive, electronics and consumer goods industries. These machines can perform tasks with precision, speed,
        and endurance beyond human capabilities, such as swearing, painting, assembling and packaging.</p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-family: Calibri;">In addition to reducing production time and cost, industrial robots can work in hazardous
        environments where
        human safety might be at risk, such as in handling toxic materials or working in extreme temperatures. As the
        demand of mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for maintaining the pace and quality required in
        modern manufacturing. The future of industrial reports includes increased collaboration between robots and
        humans, with robots assisting workers in complex tasks that require high level decision making.</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: Calibri;">Overview of Humanoid Robots and their Capabilties. </h2>
    <p align="justify" style="font-family: Calibri;">Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human behavior, both an appearance and
        functionality. These robots are capable of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such as assisting
        in healthcare, customer service, and education. The defining characteristics of humanoid robots is their ability
        to interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced algorithms for speech recognition, facial
        expression, interpretation and decision making.
    </p>
    <p align="justify" style="font-family: Calibri;">Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO, Sofia and Atlas, which
        have been. Designed for various purposes, from assisting the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous tasks
        in disaster-stricken areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral part of research and development where
        they help scientists better understand human cognition, biomechanics and social interaction. With continued
        advancement in artificial intelligence and robotics, humanoid robots are expected to become more autonomous,
        capable of learning from experience and performing increasingly complex tasks in the future.
